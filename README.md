# AutoRes
Automatic desktop resolution changer plugin.

The resolution is configured by the **autores.toml** file and it must be next to the DLL.

The injection is up to you. For example, you can use [Special K](https://github.com/SpecialKO/SpecialK) and configure it as an [custom plugin](https://wiki.special-k.info/en/SpecialK/Tools#custom-plugin) with **Early** loading.
